// what is FP?
// It's a way to think and design your solution to a problem.
// Different from OOP

// Functions are at the center of designs
// Functions act as both algorithm and data
// Solving problems only by composing (combining) functions, with each function solving a small piece
// of the problem
// FP is declarative, so you specify WHAT you wnat, rather than imperitive: HOW you want it
// This is achieved by chaining transformations over input
// By limiting power and scope of individual functions, we get much more control and discipline

// "Bad designs produce unexpected consequences whereas good designs produce unexpected benefits"

// Why FP?
// Less time needed to reason about the code
// Less boilerplace code
// Less coding, more happening
// Less time needed to write tests, meaning more confidence
// More reusable code, since functions don't have side effects, and values are immutable
//
